###What this project is not about
1. I focused more on the functionality not on the UI and responsiveness of website across 
different browsers (if needed I can do that too)
2. BEM convention of class naming in css (as there are not much css in this project)
3. There is no seperate css file for each component for example App.css for App.js component.
